***|USAGE|***
./3600dns @<server:port> <name>
port   :  (Optional) The UDP port number of the DNS server. Default value: 53
server :  (Required) The IP address of the DNS server, in a.b.c.d format
name   :  (Required) The name to query for.
*************

************
After sending the request, the client will wait for a reply for 5 seconds.
If no reply is heard within this time window, the client will exit indicating
that a timeout occurred, by printing out the NORESPONSE message.

The client will then wait for a response from the server, and print the result to standard
output using the following format:

IP <tab> <IP address> <tab> <auth|nonauth>
CNAME <tab> <alias> <tab> <auth|nonauth>
NOTFOUND
NORESPONSE
ERROR <tab> <description of the error>

If an response to a query contains multiple answers (such as multiple IP addresses or aliases),
The client will print an IP or CNAME line for each one of these. If the requested name does not
exist, The client will print a NOTFOUND line. If no response is ever received from the server (i.e.,
you've waited 5 seconds and not received anything), The client will print a NORESPONSE line.

Finally, if any other error occurs, The client will print an ERROR line containing a description
of the error.

***|DEBUGGING|***
Throughout the development of the project there were numerous times where I
needed to printf the values of certain variables in the packet in order to troubleshoot problems.
Because of this I strategically placed comments denoted debugging functions. You can toggle
debug mode off or on by setting the DEBUG constant at the top of 3600dns.c file to "1".
I also used GDB to get past certain memory stack errors.
